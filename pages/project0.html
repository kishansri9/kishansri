          I revamped the Humbercurrent website, ensuring responsiveness across both mobile and desktop platforms. This transformation followed a comprehensive audit of the existing website, utilizing design tools such as Figma, Illustrator, and Miro.

          I was presented with two options for redesigning a website as part of my academic project: the MyHumber Website and the HumberCurrent website. I opted for the HumberCurrent website due to a personal connection. Upon receiving my visa approval, I attempted to connect with individuals in my related programs from my country or state. After an extensive search, I discovered this webpage; however, it had several inconveniences that I couldn't discern technically at that time. Now, I have the opportunity to delve deeper, identify areas for improvement, and enhance the website to the best of my abilities.

            <h3>Usability Testing</h3> <br>
            <p>After testing I have done these changes.</p>
            <li>
              Feedback suggested considering a different shade of green for the meeting booking confirmation and a preference for a greener logo.
            </li>
            <li>A recommendation was made to relocate the section description on the meeting response page, but the decision was made to keep it in its current position for essential information visibility.</li>
            <li>
              To facilitate seamless switching between student and program pages, an address bar was introduced, ensuring users maintain clear awareness of their location.
            </li>
            <li>The necessity of a header cover element, initially not part of the high-fidelity prototype, was questioned, leading to add again.</li>
