          <p> Our final video would be optimized for
            a TV/Youtube promotion.
            It`s landscape, 1920 x 1080 pixels, and

          <h3>Play-by-play breakdown</h3>
          <img src="../assets/images/play.png">
          <p> “Uplifts your comfort” is the slogan of this video,
            so we are going to emphasize on “comfort” side of
            the slogan and we have targeted a college student
            to demonstrate that.
            The video starts with a piece of a fast music and
            we see close-up shots of our model (the student)
            packs her stuff in the library of the college and
            gets prepared to leave; then she ties the shoelace
            and starts to walk.
            We have multiple shots from different angles to
            demonstrate all the details we have in mind. These
            shots should be done in 5 to 10 seconds.</p>
            <p> We would see her walking through hallways,
              classes, indoor spaces, and outdoors. and this
              would take 15 seconds.
              The person and the shoe are in the center and
              all other locations change in order to show
              how comfortable and practical would be this
              particular pair of shoes in all occasions. These
              shots are medium shots and some close-ups
              too!</p>
              <p> 
                Finally, we have some in-studio shots (stop
motion video) with the shoe in front of a green
backdrop curtain, so we can have different
backgrounds set for this part. The slogan and
the logo appear at the end, and the last part is
almost 5 to 10 seconds.
The video has no voice-over, and all parts and
acts are based on the music rhythm.

          <img src="../assets/images/locations-mobile.png">
          <p>The actress would be one of my college
            students; we start in the college library,
            hallways, gym, and classes.
            Then we head out for outdoor shots. They
            would be captured in the Humber arboretum,
            bus stop, and entrance hallways.</p>
