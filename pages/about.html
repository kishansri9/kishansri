          Hello there, I'm Kishan Reddy LV, also known as Kishansri. I wear multiple hats - a photographer, an engineer, and a budding UX/UI designer. I've always believed that life can take unexpected turns with a single moment.
        </p>
        <p>
From my early days, I've been captivated by the world of arts, finding inspiration in the beauty of everyday things. Sketching rough ideas and being influenced by my cousins who work in media fueled my passion. Two pivotal moments shaped my journey - interactions with my cousins and a movie that left a lasting impact, "I Am Legend."
</p>
<p>
Despite pursuing engineering like any typical Indian, I approached it as a challenge and graduated with distinction. The exposure to computer technology broadened my horizons, but my love for the arts remained unwavering. Transitioning into photography, I embarked on a learning journey. Starting as an intern, I worked my way up to become a content creator and photographer in my hometown, Hyderabad, India. From interiors to food, events, 360-degree, VR experiences, and portraits, each shoot provided valuable insights into work and life. Beyond commercial work, my fascination with minimalism and street photography drives me to showcase the world from my unique perspective. I've been fortunate to earn recognition, including a solo exhibition at the Toronto Public Library in January 2023.
</p>
<p>
  In 2020, I decided to expand my horizons and discovered a new passion in UX/UI designâ€”a realm that resonated with my artistic inclinations. Pursuing a Multimedia Design and Development program at Humber, Toronto, I delved into diverse technologies, including UI/UX, web development, graphic design, motion design, and AR exploration. Projects ranged from Figma prototypes to websites and AR installations.
</p>
<p> 
In the realm of UX, I'm equipped to lead projects from ideation to usability testing. My skills extend to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for turning designs into reality. I bring designs to life with typography animations using After Effects and create AR experiences using Adobe Aero and Stager. Proficient in photo and video editing with tools like Lightroom, Photoshop, and Adobe Premiere, I eagerly anticipate creating more impactful work and enhancing user experiences. 
</p>
Thank you for joining me on this journey!
