      <div class="description">
        This is a construction company which works on real estate and construction
work. So I decided to design a logo which reflects buildings rising from the ground. So designed
round edged rectangular box as background with diagonal lines pattern from left bottom towards
right top. I used two different shades of blue to bring 3D depth for the pattern as it looks like a
building. On top of that shape typed LSR company name and made it simple and emphasized
with bold white colour font. 
        <h2> Animation</h2>
        <div class="description">
          My logo reveals animation should replicate formation of blocks, patterns
and diagonal lines etc. so that It connects viewers with the meaning of ‘construction’. At the same
time it should be royal and rich in design and shape. For this animation, I use principles like
ease ,timing , dimensionality and space etc. first pattern appears full frame with diagonal lines,
then rotates clockwise and then lines make another pattern in opposite direction. Next, the
rectangular shapes appear so the remaining part is masked. Finally, company name forms as
masking and unmasking parelley. In the last frame, name appears as static and ends.

          <p> After trying different styles, different colour effects, I decided to go with this final logo

            because its simple and emphasizing logo and company name effectively. And also color shades
            
            brings architectural 3D feeling as background. I decided this colour to represent energetic
            
            characterstic of the company.</p>
